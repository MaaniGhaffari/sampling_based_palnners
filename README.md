# sampling_based_planners
---
This is a library for some of the sampling-based motion planning algorithms implemented in MATLAB. Currently the following methods are available: rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), rapidly-exploring random graph (RRG), asymptotically optimal RRT (RRT*). The incrementally-exploring information gathering (IIG) which is built on rapidly-exploring information gathering (RIG) technique is coming soon.

- IIG (coming soon)

```matlab
>> out = iig_planner()
```

- RRT

```matlab
>> out = rrt_planner()
```

- RRG

```matlab
>> out = rrg_planner()
```


- RRT*

```matlab
>> out = rrtstar_planner()
```


> *The implementations depend on the MATLAB built-in kd-tree objects.*

> *It is possible to make the planners kinodynamic by modifying the* **steer.m** *function.*
